# Resumee
quick description about me and about what can i do

## Personal Information - About Me
- name: Alexandru Andrew
- age: 21
- manjaro linux user
- python full stack web developer

## Short Sescription
imi place sa `automatizez orice actiune spre simplificarea vietii`, pentru ca dupa cum stim, societatea evolueaza exponential si se devine si mai complexa decat a fost in trecut, iar noi trebuie sa fim la curent cu orice, iar asta implica timp, timp care trebuie alocat si nu pierdut pentru lucruri care pot fi automatizate

examples:
- why to make your own coffee when you can put it in the coffee maker and schedule the device to start making coffee at 6 am

what i have automated so far:
- deschidea computerului si initializarea cu toate applicatiile pe care le folosesti cand ai de lucru
- file backup to remote server with rsync and ssh

## Long Description
##### > sunt genul de persoana care si-ar automatiza totul in casa

##### > sunt dechis la lucruri si concepte noi, daca ma ajuta sa ma imbunatatesc, evident

##### > sunt foarte organizat in tot ceea ce fac
- file systemul meu este structurat pe categorii pe care le respect foarte strict, nu pun un fisier intr-un folder care nu este related cu acel fisier
- in casa toate sunt la punct

##### > sunt foarte dedicat in munca pe care o fac pentru sunt perfectionist, imi place ca totul sa iasa perfect si mai ales, din prima, la asta aspir
daca nu fac treaba calumea, atunci de ce o mai fac?
##### > ador sa invat lucruri noi, din orice domeniu, mai ales din IT
oricand, la orice ora (exceptie cand dorm :) ) sunt dispus sa ascult pe cineva care poate sa ma invete ceva nou
##### > iubesc tehnologia, wifi, servers, networking, touchscreen, senzori, etc...
daca as putea sa calatoresc in viitor as face-o sa vad cum a evoluat tehnologia

##### > nu renunt niciodata
##### > ma adaptez super repede la lucruri noi

##### > altele:
- am viziuni mari, dar pacat ca nu am market cap de miliarde de dolari, ca probabil as fi schimbat planeta
- suntem toti in proces de invatare pana murim

##### > vreau ca tot ce fac sa imi aduca productivitate, sa nu pierd nicio secunda, sunt workoholic

##### > nu-mi place sa pierd timpul
##### > imi place sa ajut oamenii, imi place sa interactionez cu ei
